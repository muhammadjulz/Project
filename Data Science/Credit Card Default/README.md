# Credit Card Default

Do you want to know if someone will default on their credit card bill the following month? The Machine Learning Credit Card Default project can help you by predicting the likelihood of a credit card customer defaulting based on various factors such as employment type, marital status, income, and credit limit.

In this project, I used a dataset containing information from credit card customers, then explored the data to gain insight into the relationships between variables. After that, we performed data preprocessing, such as removing missing values, removing outliers, and performing feature scaling.

Then, I built 7 machine learning models such as logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, decision tree, and random forest, KNN, Naive Bayes and Ada Boost to predict whether a customer will default on the bill in the following month. Also, I evaluated the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.

The Machine Learning Credit Card Default project can help banks and financial institutions evaluate credit risk and minimize losses. In addition, this project can also help customers to understand how certain factors can affect their ability to pay credit card bills.
