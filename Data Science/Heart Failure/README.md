# Heart Failure

The Machine Learning Heart Failure project can help you predict a person's likelihood of developing heart failure based on various factors such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

In this project, we used a dataset containing information from patients who experienced heart failure, then we explored the data to gain insight into the relationship between variables. After that, we perform data preprocessing, such as removing missing values, removing outliers, and performing feature scaling.

Then, we built several machine learning models such as ADA Boost and random forest to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients. We also evaluate the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score.

The Machine Learning Heart Failure project can help doctors and medical personnel evaluate the risk of heart failure in patients and provide more effective treatment. In addition, this project can also help the public to understand the factors that can affect the risk of heart failure.
